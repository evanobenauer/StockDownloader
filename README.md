# StockDownloader

My Stock Data Downloader application is a simple app that downloads live stock data to a CSV file depending on the selected time frame. 
The app has a GUI that makes it fun to watch the stock download. 
This application is built using GlowUI and GlowLib

I decided to create this application to retrieve live, intraday stock data for any time frame of my choosing because I refused to pay for an API to do this.

Live data is retrieved using Yahoo Finance. Different live sources can be adapted to the program and it would still function properly.

The program can run on any always-on server in order to constantly recieve and archive data.

PLANS:
Eventually, this program will have the capability to be retrieved by other devices across the internet.
Portions of the program will be able to be adapted to a statistical analysis program in the future
